# Protein Classification with Complex-Valued 1D Convolutional Neural Networks and Comparison with Real-Valued 1D Convolutional Neural Networks:

### Three forms of protein sequences (DNA, Codon and Amino Acid sequences) are converted to complex numbers with the proposed complex-based method. Protein Classification is performed with Complex-Valued 1D Convolutional Neural Networks using the obtained complex sequences.

### Sequences encoded with Integer coding on the same data set are classified with Real-Valued 1D Convolutional Neural Networks. The results are compared.

### The study is carried out separately for DNA, codon and amino acid sequences.

### In the study, Data import, data preprocessing, digitization of protein sequences and classification with deep convolutional networks are followed.
